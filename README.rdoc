= Redmine sudo plugin

A Redmine plugin to make admin users become super user before they can
actually employ admin powers.

This adds a 'Become superuser' link to the accout menu, if current
user is an admin.  The user must click this link and enter his
password on the page shown next to actually become superuser.  When
superuser permissions are no longer required, the user may click
'Giveup superuser' link.

Superuser sessions expire automatically in 15 minutes (configurable.)
